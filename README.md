### Requirements

```
<Linux>
  Python 3.X
  Python 3.X's pip module
  Any linux distribution that uses the 'apt' package manager
  release.py (this will install all dependencies)
```

To get started, [download](https://github.com/MEMESCOEP/AUSL/blob/main/release.py) 
```release.py```
and run it as root:

>&nbsp;sudo python3 release.py&nbsp;


<strong><bold>Wait for the script to finish.<br><i>(This will take a long time, as it downloads/installs dependencies and compiles AUSL.py to an executable binary.)</i></bold></strong>
